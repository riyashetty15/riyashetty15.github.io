                        <h2>A Brief Description</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Crimes have always existed in society, and it is impossible to have a society free of them; however, we must always look for ways to minimize or prevent them. Crime rates in the United States have fluctuated over time, peaking in 1992 and then beginning to fall significantly. This pattern continued until 2015 when it began to rise slightly. Although this trend reversed in 2018 and 2019, violent crime increased significantly in 2020. We discovered that violent crime increased by nearly 30% during the pandemic. The primary goal of this project is to understand how the crime rates have changed since 2015 and which types of crimes are more prevalent in the United States.</p>
                        <p class = "lead">The main motivation of this project is to understand what
                            factors contributed to this sudden increase in crime rate and to identify what kinds of crimes are
                            more prevalent in the US.

                        <h4>Insights for the US data:</h4>
                        <p>On an overall level, we observed that the crime rate decreased from 2017 but increased sharply again in 2020 for crimes like violent crimes. This supports our argument that the crime rate has increased during the pandemic period.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Insights for the Cities data:</h4>
                        <p>It can be concluded that the highly metropolitan cities have the highest crime rates, this maybe because of the high unemployment rates in these regions.
                        There can be seen a rise in the crime rates from the year 2020, due to the given covid situation where people lost their jobs and survival was their first instinct.
                        The crimes were almost consistently the same on almost all days of the week. 
                        When we looked up the location with the crime rates in each of these cities, we understood that these places had the most residences, tourist attractions, street-side foods, etc. Hence, it can be concluded that since these places were tourist attractions, they attracted more criminals as well.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Insights for the Bloomington data:</h4>
                        <p>We observe more or less consistent crime rates throughout the year from 2006 to 2016 with a sudden drastic increase in the crime rate in 2017 and 2018. It seems very unreasonable for such a drastic increase and it might be the case that some changes in the system were brought into place and a lot more cases were reported.
                        Most of the crimes show a consistent decrease over the years except Violent crimes and Aggravated Assault.</p>
